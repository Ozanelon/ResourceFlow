Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                          Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its author.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
To understand the concept, you should read the article “Free Software
– Free Society.”

The GPL-3.0 license is designed to prevent proprietary use of software
and ensures that anyone who uses or redistributes the software must
also share their modifications or derivative works under the same license.
By doing so, it protects users' freedom and ensures that the software
remains free for future generations of users and developers.

   0. Definitions.

   This License refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   The "Program" means any work covered by this License.  Each licensee
   is addressed as "you."

   "You" includes the programmer or other person who takes a work and
   creates a derivative work, as well as the person who distributes the
   work.

   "Licenses" include: the right to use, modify, or distribute software.

   1. You may copy, modify, and distribute the Program, provided that
   you meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must provide a copy of the GNU GPL-3.0 license to the recipient
   of the program, or provide a written offer to give them the full text of
   the license along with any software received.

   (b) You must make it clear that you have modified the original Program.
   You must ensure that your modifications are accompanied by clear
   documentation of what has been changed and why, so that others can
   understand the changes you made.

   2. The Program may be distributed or modified under the terms of
   the GPL-3.0 license. It is always advisable to acknowledge authorship
   in order to ensure proper credit.

   3. No warranty is provided for the Program, and the software is
   provided “as is.” The authors are not responsible for any damage
   or consequences that result from the use of the software.

   4. If you redistribute a modified version, you must provide clear
   instructions or disclaimers regarding the modifications you have made.

   5. When you distribute the program or derivative works, you must also
   provide access to the source code under the terms of the GPL-3.0 license.

   6. You cannot add additional restrictions on the software, and any
   additional permissions granted must be compatible with the license.

   7. If you choose to distribute under the GPL, any recipient has the
   right to change and redistribute the program under the same terms.

   This license assures that the software remains free for everyone to
   use, share, and modify.
